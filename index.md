## Introduction
I'm a undergraduate student attending **University of California San Diego** and although I am a sophmore, I have **senior** standing. :) This is because I took way too many AP classes in High School. I'm current a tutor for CSE 12 and used to tutor CSE 11. I'm very fascinated by startups and personal businesses and hope to one day start my own business. Since I hang around a lot of entrepreneur spaces, I'm the President of an entrepreneur organization on campus called Sigma Eta Pi. And lastly, I am a math-cs major so this class is not required for me. I'm an avid manga, manhwa, and anime enjoyer and I read a lot of manga and manhwa. I solely took this because I wanted to learn more about what Software Engineering is since I've seen SWE being thrown around everywhere and I genuinely want to learn the development process and other aspects of being a Software Engineer.

## My Favorite CEOs/Entreprenuers (There are more but I wanted to include just 3)
- Steve Jobs
- Jeff Bezos
- Bill Gates

## My Favorite CEOs/Entreprenuers Ranked
1. Jeff Bezos (cause same name and although I don't buy frequently, when I do I use Amazon, and yes I think Amazon mostly make their money through AWS, not the store)
2. Bill Gates (cause I use windows more than I use mac)
3. Steven Jobs (I love his approach to problem solving, the first two just outweighted him)
